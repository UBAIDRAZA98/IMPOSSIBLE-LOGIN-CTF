# IMPOSSIBLE-LOGIN-CTF
This repository contains challenges of Hackemon CTF 2025 organized by ACM SIGSAC
 Challenge Writeup – "IMPOSSIBLE LOGIN" (Beginner-Friendly)
This CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge is based on:

Login flow tricks

Session management

Finding hidden pages (endpoints)

🔍 Step-by-Step Guide
1. Starting Point – /login
When you open the main page ( / ), it automatically redirects you to /login.

The login form asks for a token, but you don’t know where to get that token yet.

2. Getting the Token – /pre-auth
Try checking if there are other hidden pages.

If you go to /pre-auth, you will see something like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Your pre-auth token: abc123xyz
This is the token you need to log in.

⚠️ Important: This token is only valid for 20 seconds! So be quick.

3. Logging In
Go back to the /login page.

Paste the token from /pre-auth into the login form.

If the token is still valid, you’ll successfully log in.

Behind the scenes, this happens:

python
Copy
Edit
session['logged_in'] = True
session['visited_race'] = False
This means you're now logged in, but you haven't completed everything yet.

4. Exploring After Login – /dashboard
After logging in, you’re sent to /dashboard.

This page doesn’t show anything useful — it's just a distraction.

5. Looking for Clues – /about
There's no real /about page, but the hint "race" may appear in a clue or description.

That word leads us to try /race, a hidden endpoint.

6. The Hidden Page – /race
When you visit /race, you see:

sql
Copy
Edit
You feel like you are on the right track...
More importantly, it updates your session:

python
Copy
Edit
session['visited_race'] = True
This means your account now remembers that you visited /race.

7. Getting the Flag – /get-flag
Now try going to /get-flag.

Two possible results:
❌ If you didn’t visit /race first:

rust
Copy
Edit
You haven't explored enough.
✅ If you did visit /race:

Copy
Edit
ACM{you_found_it}
⚠️ Tricks & Distractions to Watch Out For:
1. Token Time Limit
The token only works for 20 seconds.

If you’re too slow, you’ll need to go back to /pre-auth and get a new one.

2. Fake Flag – /fake-flag
This page shows:

Copy
Edit
ACM{this_is_a_trap}
It’s a decoy, not the real flag!

3. Forbidden Page – /debug
If you try /debug, you get a 403 Forbidden error.

It's just there to distract you.

4. Robots.txt File
If you check /robots.txt, you see:

bash
Copy
Edit
Disallow: /race
Disallow: /debug
This file is meant for search engines, but you can use it to find hidden paths!

✅ Final Summary
To solve the challenge:

Go to /pre-auth → copy the token.

Use it at /login quickly.

Visit /race to set the right session variable.

Now go to /get-flag → 🎉 Flag revealed: ACM{you_found_it}
